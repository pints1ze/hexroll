VillainousPlanConcealment:
  Name: Concealment
  Description: !jinja |
    * __{{Name}}__ - {{LongText}}
    * From\: {{FromWhom}}
    * Method\: {{Method}}
  LongText: the villain is trying to conceal himself, to conceal his past acts, conceal his organization, conceal evidence, etc.
  FromWhom: !weighted
    - Another villain
    - Another villain's minions
    - Bounty hunters or adventurers^2
    - Foreign authorities or military
    - Former victim
    - Group of former allies
    - Local authorities or militia^3
  Method:
    - Assassination. The Villain is targeting anyone who could identify him from a past identity he wants to keep secret, or is killing those who know about his plans. In other words, the villain might be trying to conceal himself or his activities; these aren't always the same. A villain engaged in secret activities might be completely certain he can't be identified, but still worried that his plot could be uncovered. Assassinations might be the last resort when a villainous plot is already starting to fall apart. The villain's minions might be his targets, too, if things have gone badly and the villain is concealing his tracks.
    - Eliminating Evidence (damage control). The villain is trying to eliminate evidence of a plan or crime that failed, and that he has written off. He might be taking several actions at once; killing his own minions that were involved, killing witnesses, stealing documents and other evidence, etc.
    - Eliminating Evidence (mopping up). The villain is eliminating evidence of a plan or crime that has succeeded - covering his tracks, in other words. If he up a usurper on the throne (to choose one example), he might still need to kill the minion or dupe who poisoned the true king. Or, he might need to change some historical records that could reveal the usurper's non-noble pedigree. Most crimes leave evidence behind.
    - Frame-up. The villain is framing another person (or monster) for a crime he committed himself. The target might be a minion, an innocent bystander the villain dislikes, or a monster such as a nearby dragon (dragons being excellent fall-guys for arsonists). Remember also; from the villain's perspective, the enemy of his enemy is not his friend - he's a potential fall guy.
    - Lair-Building (rural). The villain is building a concealed lair to hide himself and his activities from the group indicated in column 1. This could be the activity of a mindless monster (in which case column 1 is irrelevant), or it might be part of the thought-out plan of a relatively intelligent mastermind.
    - Lair-Building (urban or village). The villain is building a hidden lair within a civilized community. Again, this could be the instinctive action of an unintelligent beast (such as a giant spider nesting in an attic, or a ghoul making tunnels under a cemetery) or might be the first step in a mastermind's plan (e.g., an evil priest digging a secret basement-complex).
    - Organization (facade). The villain is creating an organization of innocent-looking minions in plain sight, but with a secret agenda for the group. The organization might be a cover story for existing minions (yes, we are all circus performers!) or it might be a way of recruiting unsuspecting locals to join. In this sort of operation, the villain is primarily trying to conceal the organization's secret operations rather than to conceal himself; he might even be a prominent citizen of the town or village where the organization is being created. His plan might include recruiting people away from the local community to a rural “temple” or “lodge,” or the organization's base might be located right in the middle of the community (for example, an innocent-looking store that actually fences stolen goods brought in by caravan from the nearby city). To determine the organization's secret agenda, you might want to roll again on the Master Table. Note that this sort of plan is almost certainly the agenda of an intelligent villain, even if the operation is run by a minion with lower intelligence.
    - Organization (secret). The villain is creating a secret organization of minions, meeting in secret with no cover story for their activities. This could be a secret cult, a plan to overthrow the government, or the unification of wererat tribes in the sewer tunnels of a large city. Secret societies can take many forms if you're creative.
    - Secret identity (establishing). The villain is disguised within the human population, and is building up a new identity for himself. He might have forged documents, or an altered body form. In this case, the villain has created a new identity - if he has taken someone's place, see below for comments.
    - Secret Identity (learning). The villain has replaced a human in the community, and is learning the details of his new identity. This is not a strategy limited to shape-changing villains; anyone can pretend to be someone from far away. The villain might be making some blunders as he impersonates the dead or absent target - he might not know, for example, that the king was a vegetarian, or where the merchant hid the key to his treasure room.
